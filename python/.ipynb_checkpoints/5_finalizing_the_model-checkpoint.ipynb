    "So far, I am only confident that two features should be in the model: average electron affinity and average d-count for the B-cation. I have ruled out the parent features and now look only at the average features. I have no yet completely ruled out tolerance factor and critical radius, but I don't believe they will add much.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will determine the best subset of features by only allowing features that contribute at least 0.05 to the average model score after electron affinity and d-electron count have been added to it. At the time of this writing, sklearn has not implemented a best subset feature selection methodology, so I will have to build one myself. If I had many features, I would write a function to do this recursively, but because I only have a few, I believe it would be more efficient and more instructive to do it step-by-step."

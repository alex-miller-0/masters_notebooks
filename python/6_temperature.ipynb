    "D\\* and k\\* are both thermally activated coefficients, meaning they are always much higher at higher temperatures. Diffusion at low temperatures is much slower because atoms vibrate with lower amplitude and this makes it tougher for ions to flow through the crystals. However, low temperatures are much more practical from an engineering standpoint because the stress on the systems is much lower and mechanical failure takes much longer to arise.\n",
